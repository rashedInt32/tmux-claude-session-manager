# tmux-claude-session-manager

[![screenshot](./docs/screenshot.jpg)](https://youtu.be/NnTV6r4l5D0)

Run many [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions across your
projects, each in its own tmux session — then **list them, see which are done
vs. still working, and jump to one** from a single popup.

If you launch Claude per-directory (one nested session per project), you quickly
end up with a dozen of them and no way to tell which are finished without opening
each one. This plugin gives you:

- 🔢 **A central picker** (`prefix` + `u`) listing every running Claude agent —
  several in one project, and any running loose in an ordinary pane.
- 🟢 **Live status** per agent — `working` / `waiting` / `idle` — read straight
  from `claude agents --json`, so you instantly see which need you. No setup.
- 👁️ **A live preview** of each agent's screen right in the picker.
- 🎯 **Smart jump** — selecting an agent switches your client to the window it
  was launched from, then resumes it in a popup over it.
- 🚀 **A launcher** (`prefix` + `y`) that opens/attaches a Claude session for the
  current directory.
- ❌ **Quick kill** (`ctrl-x`) of a finished agent from the picker.

Status needs no configuration. Claude Code publishes each agent's own state and
the picker reads it — there are no hooks to install.

## Prerequisites

- **tmux ≥ 3.2** (for `display-popup`)
- **[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)** — the picker UI
- **[jq](https://jqlang.org/)** — parses `claude agents --json`
- **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** ≥ 2.1.139 — for the
  `claude agents` command (`claude --version` to check)
- bash; macOS or Linux

## Install (tpm)

Add to `~/.tmux.conf` (or `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf`):

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'craftzdog/tmux-claude-session-manager'
```

Then hit `prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd> to install.

> **Keybinding note:** by default the plugin binds `prefix` + `y` (launch) and
> `prefix` + `u` (list). If your config binds those elsewhere, either change the
> options below, or make sure the plugin loads **after** your own bindings (put
> `run '~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm'` _after_ them) so the one you want wins.

### Manual install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/craftzdog/tmux-claude-session-manager ~/clone/path
```

Add to `~/.tmux.conf`, then reload (`prefix` + <kbd>r</kbd> or `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`):

```tmux
run-shell ~/clone/path/claude_session_manager.tmux
```

## Usage

| Key            | Action                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix` + `y` | Launch (or re-attach to) a Claude session for the current directory, in a popup |
| `prefix` + `u` | Open the agent picker                                                           |

Inside the picker:

| Key                       | Action                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enter`                   | Jump to the agent (see [How it works](#how-it-works))           |
| `ctrl-x`                  | Kill the highlighted agent                                      |
| `↑` / `↓`, type to filter | fzf navigation                                                  |

Agents needing your attention (`waiting`, `idle`) sort to the top.

Every running Claude gets its own row — the picker identifies each by its process,
not by its tmux session. So several agents in one project all show up separately,
as does a Claude you started by hand in an ordinary pane.

## Options

Set any of these before the plugin loads (defaults shown):

```tmux
set -g @claude_launch_key     'y'        # prefix key: launch/open for current dir
set -g @claude_list_key       'u'        # prefix key: open the picker
set -g @claude_command        'claude'   # command run in new sessions
set -g @claude_args           ''         # extra args appended to the command
set -g @claude_session_prefix 'claude-'  # tmux session name prefix
set -g @claude_popup_width     '90%'     # popup width
set -g @claude_popup_height    '90%'     # popup height
set -g @claude_fzf_options    ''         # extra options passed to the fzf picker
```

For example, to skip permission prompts in launched sessions:

```tmux
set -g @claude_args '--dangerously-skip-permissions'
```

`@claude_fzf_options` is passed straight to `fzf`, so you can add your own
bindings — for instance, vim-style navigation in the picker:

```tmux
set -g @claude_fzf_options '--bind j:down --bind k:up'
```

## How it works

- The **launcher** creates a detached `claude-<hash-of-dir>` tmux session running
  `claude`, records the window it came from in `@claude_origin`, and attaches to
  it in a popup.
- **`claude agents --json`** is the source of truth for what is running and how it
  is doing. Each Claude session self-reports its state (`busy` / `waiting` /
  `idle`) to a supervisor daemon, which that command publishes. Nothing here scans
  processes for a `claude` command name — on macOS a pane reports its parent shell,
  never the `claude` child running inside it.
- **`agents.sh`** pairs each running Claude with the tmux pane it occupies by
  joining `pid` → `tty` → pane. That join is why identity is the Claude _process_
  rather than the tmux session, and therefore why several agents in one project
  each get their own row. It costs three subprocesses per render, whatever the
  number of sessions or panes.
- The **age column** is the mtime of the agent's transcript — its last sign of
  life. `claude agents --json` reports only `startedAt`, never a last-activity
  time. A brand-new agent that has yet to take a turn shows `-`.
- The **picker** renders those rows with a live `capture-pane` preview. On `enter`
  a **dedicated** agent (in a `claude-*` session) resumes in the popup over the
  window it was launched from, while a **loose** one (any other pane) is focused in
  place. `ctrl-x` kills the Claude process itself: a dedicated session dies with
  its last window, and a loose pane keeps the shell that hosted it.
- Pressing `prefix` + `u` **from inside a session popup** detaches that popup
  first (closing it), then reopens the picker full-size on the outer host client —
  so you never end up with a cramped popup-in-popup.
